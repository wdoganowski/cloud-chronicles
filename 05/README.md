# Scaling to New Heights: Go3's Success Story of Strategic Cloud Migration

In the fast-changing world of Over-the-Top (OTT) services, our recent move from on-premises to the AWS cloud marks a crucial moment in Go3's growth story. This strategic change was a big success, driven by our goal of scalability, resilience, and improved monitoring capabilities, establishing us as a top player in the industry.

## Motivation for Change

We migrated for three main reasons:

- **Seamless Scaling:** Moving to AWS allowed us to easily adapt to different user demands, overcoming limitations of our previous setup. This flexibility in scaling has become essential in our ever-changing industry.
- **Advanced Monitoring:** Utilizing AWS's advanced monitoring tools gave us real-time insights, enabling us to proactively address issues and optimize operations.
- **Building Resilience:** Strengthening our service's resilience and ensuring consistent availability became a key focus of our migration, guaranteeing uninterrupted services for our valued users.

## Strategic Decision-making and Implementation

We carefully evaluated various cloud service providers before choosing AWS based on considerations like resources, costs, and region specifics. We selected the AWS region that optimized performance while ensuring cost-effectiveness and operational control.

During the migration, we focused on transitioning applications while retaining our Content Delivery Network (CDN) on-premises due to significant data transfer and storage demands.

To save costs, we integrated Cloudflare with CloudFront, efficiently managing requests and adding a cost-effective layer to our services. Additionally, the AWS deployment enhanced our observability, seamlessly integrating with on-premises solutions like Zabbix, Nagios, and New Relic. This integration strengthened our monitoring capabilities, allowing synchronized monitoring of both on-premises and cloud infrastructure.

## Ensuring a Seamless Experience

After the migration, we ensured a seamless user experience without disruptions. Currently, our performance matches our previous on-premises setup. However, the full potential of AWS will be realized under increased loads.

## Looking Forward: The Promise of Future Growth

Our successful migration positions Go3 for substantial future growth and innovation. We are focused on fine-tuning scalability and optimizing costs to achieve significant savings. Doubling our services in the coming years, free from on-prem resource constraints, sets the stage for an exciting future.

## Conclusion: Our Strategic Triumph

Our migration to AWS showcases Go3's resilience and strategic excellence, promising improved services and a strong foundation for future growth and innovation in the dynamic OTT landscape. This success allows us to leverage the limitless capabilities of AWS, propelling our services into a future marked by innovation and sustained success.
