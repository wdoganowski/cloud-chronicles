Here is the draft introduction, which needs to be also rewritten to match the style of the whole article:

"To create a successful migration strategy, it is crucial to start by gathering application portfolio data, such as extracts from a configuration management database. This data should then be evaluated against the seven common migration strategies, also known as the 7 Rs, for moving applications to the AWS Cloud: refactor, re-platform, repurchase, rehost, relocate, retain, and retire.

Once the initial portfolio analysis is completed, a plan can be developed for how each application will be migrated. It's important to regularly optimize this plan for future migration waves and teams, using lessons learned and new data that becomes available during the migration process. The following diagram illustrates the strategy planning process."
